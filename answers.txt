1) how does it handle base path of the video chunk? Like if the playlist file has chunks from two different videos, with 2 different paths, how can we handle that?

(Absolute paths)
If each video has its own separate directories, you can use absolute paths in the .m3u8 file for each chunk. For example:

#EXTINF:5.0,
http://example.com/video1/chunk1.ts
#EXTINF:5.0,
http://example.com/video1/chunk2.ts
#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY
#EXTINF:5.0,
http://example.com/video2/chunk1.ts
#EXTINF:5.0,
http://example.com/video2/chunk2.ts

I use relative paths,
I will attach the m3u8 file and you can have a look, I implemented this using #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY, I added in two different places in the middle of the player another video with a different size (Time of the other video is 08:51 and 12:18)


2) And instead of giving it url of m3u8 file, can we pass it the file-data manually?

Yes, you can pass the contents of the .m3u8 file manually to the HLS player instead of specifying a URL. For example, in HLS.js you can dynamically load a playlist using a string or Blob.

const m3u8Content = `
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXTINF:5.0,
video1/chunk1.ts
#EXTINF:5.0,
video1/chunk2.ts
#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY
#EXTINF:2.0,
video2/chunk1.ts
#EXTINF:2.1,
video2/chunk2.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
`;

// Create Blob from m3u8 data
const blob = new Blob([m3u8Content], { type: 'application/vnd.apple.mpegurl' });
// Create a URL for this Blob
const blobUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);


3) Pls also explore can the chunk size be different in size? This may be needed if we trim a file from the mid of a chunk

Chunk sizes can vary in HLS, but it is important that cropping or resizing chunks does not disrupt keyframes or cause playback problems.

Let's say you want to trim the video at the 10th second of the second chunk. In this case, you create a new chunk that will start from the nearest keyframe after trimming, and its size may be different from the default.
